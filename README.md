# Project module

Welcome to the project module! 

This project module will simulate parts of a real working experience in a typical software company. 

The next 6 weeks you will work for the company called *the open-source factory*. The open source factory is a company that works for free on various open-source projects that make the web a better place. You just got hired as an intern on the team, and your goal is to help the company achieve their dreams. In your six weeks at the company you will start at level 1 responsibility (limited responsibility), and based on your performance, you can grow in your responsbility level. The more responsibility levels you gain, the more complex things become. 

***

Level 1. (limited responsibility)

When you start at a company as an intern or junior developer, you will typically start working on small **issues** on an existing product. The more senior members of the company have defined mostly what issues need to be fixed on an existing product, and will divide the issues to be fixed over different members of the team. You will work solo on an issue, and the more senior people and your colleagues (fellow students) will help you in how to approach the problem that needs to be solved. 

**Goal**: Solve mulitple issues assigned to you with well written quality code. Merge your code with the existing project. 

**Project**: Open-source project managed directly by Open-Source Factory. (we have written the code of the project, therefore control the workflow completely)

***

Level 2. (intermediate responsibility) 

You got promoted! You are now trusted to work for external clients, meaning open-source projects that are not built by the Open-source Factory. This means that your code needs the approval of external people in order to be merged! This means that there's more responsibilty for you to make sure that you understand the issue and the product well. Since this is an external project, this means that you will need to do more research by yourself as your team might not have all the answers. 

**Goal**: Solve mulitple issues assigned to you with well written quality code. Get your merge approved by the community. 

**Project**: External open-source project. The more stars the repository, the more credits earned. 

***

Level 3. (professional responsibilty)

Your bosses are very happy with you, and would like to hear what your ideas are about improving products. Instead of being told what issues to solve, you get to write a small proposal of a new feature for an existing open-source project. Then you will have to divide this new feature into smaller pieces (backlog items/issues) that need to be built. When you have done this, you can start building the feature solo, or together with teammates that are willing to participate on the project. 

***

**Important:**

The rules:

* Your Goal in order to graduate: Get promoted to level 2 and solve at least **two** significant issues of an external open source project. Your teacher will decide what is significant.

* You are responsible for your own succes in this project, and you are in charge of solving the issues in front of you. If you have problems, you ask questions to your teachers or fellow students. If you don't get the help you need there, you ask other teachers or HYF staff for help. 

* Under no circumstances you will come on Sunday with the story that you had a problem and that you couldn't do anything because of that. If there is a problem, you will make steps to try to make the problem go away. We can help you find what steps those are, but doing nothing is unacceptable. 

* Under no circumstances you will go home on Sunday without knowing what to do that following week. If your tasks are not clear, you make sure your teachers give you clear tasks.
