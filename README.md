# Project

Welcome to the Project module! Congratulations on making it this far!

In the upcoming 7 weeks we'll be delving deeper into the specifics of what it means to work as a web developer in a real tech company. Starting today you are hired to work for HackYourFuture's secret company **Open Source Factory**, welcome to the team!

Your job is simple (but not easy): produce a a fully functioning full-stack application that makes the lives of other people in the world a little better.

## Learning Goals

During the Project you will work on your technical and communication skills.

Technical skills:

- How to `build a complete full-stack application`
- Understanding `how each part of an application relates` to the rest
- What it means to work on a `feature`
- How to work with `GIT in a team setting`
- Writing `readable code`

Communication skills:

- How to `communicate effectively` with team members
- `Keeping track` of the project progress
- Knowing if you `understand what's asked` of you
- How to `communicate with non-developers` about what you're doing
- Learning how to be `solutions-oriented`

## Project Outline

This module will consist of 7 weeks immersed into the web developer life. Each week you'll working towards completing your full-stack application. In the following we'll discuss what you'll be doing week by week:
