# Project Module
Here you can find specifications and deadlines for the project module

###Introduction

##Project proposal

In the project proposal you will explain your problem definition. If you have chosen one of the projects that was presented to you, you are expected to communicate to the mentor/teacher who presented the idea about the requirements of the project.

An important part of the project proposal is understanding the limitations and possibilities of the platform that you will be building your software on. This will result in a proposal document that thoroughly describes the following aspects of your application:
 * What features will be exposed to the end user?
 * What problem will your application solve for the user?
 * It should include a sketch of the interface of your application
 * What data sets and data sources will you need?
 * How will you get the data in the right form for your application?
 * What separate parts of the application can be defined, and how should these work together?
 * What external components do you need to make certain features possible (APIs)?
 * Any problems that may arise during development
 * Give a short review of similar applications (what do they offer? how have they implemented it?)

###Repository on Github

1. Go to https://github.com/new and create a new code repository. Check the box to initialize the repository with a readme document:
2. Clone the repository to your computer using Git. Don’t know how? Head to Code School and do their Git course!
3. Make shore you and your project partner both have push access to the repository
4. Edit the plain text document called README.md. The .md extension indicates its Markdown formatting style. Have you never written Markdown before? Refer to the reference for more information. Write your proposal in that document. The proposal document should be well-written and clearly formatted. Do not forget to include a title, your name, and a paragraph summary of the application goals at the top.
4. As you will need to include some sketches into your proposal, put these images in a doc folder inside your repository. (Use exactly that name, for standard’s sake!)
5. Now, copy the URL of the GitHub page for your project and submit it on Trello. It will be of the form https://github.com/mkruijt/Programmeerproject

##Design document

Now that you have written your project proposal you can start looking at you problem in a more technical fashion.

###Framework mapping:
Based on your project proposal you are expected to now fully map different parts of your project:
 * Describe thoroughly how the user interface will work, will be handled
 * Where is your data coming from?
 * How will the different parts work together to form a complete application?
 * Give advanced sketches of the different UIs that explain which features are connected to underlying APIs, frameworks that you will be using to provide the functionality of your application.
 * Provide a list of data sources, database tables and fields (and their types) that you’ve decided to implement

During this phase of defining your application, teachers and mentors are here to help you spot if there are fundamental problems that need to be solved, or if there technical limitations that will prevent you from finishing the application.
The design document (DESIGN.md) should be uploaded in your project repository on Github and handed in on Trello.
 	
##Prototype Version

You will now create a prototype of your application’s user interface. It will probably change extensively in the following weeks, but doing this now should provide a good starting point for further development. By creating a prototype this early, you can focus on more fundamental problems in later weeks.

###Components:
 * To create a fairly complete prototype, make sure that all screens are there and navigation is working. 
 * Controls on screen should work and basic input and output of data should be functional.
 * If you need data from an external source, you must have a working script to import the data from a file or a working connection to the live data source.
 * Any data preprocessing scripts should be contained in an entirely separate folder in your repository, called scripts.

Commit and push all new code to GitHub. Don’t forget to update your README.md if you have made any big changes to your project! Add the link to your project on Trello.
	
##Alpha Version

git commit and git push every day!

This week, you’ll work towards presenting an alpha version of your project. 

Creating an alpha version of your project:
 * Make sure that you have all your data ready this week, 
 * and that there is basic interaction, 
 * core functionality is mostly implemented (but probably buggy!).
	
Submitting:

You will need to submit your alpha code by pushing it to GitHub, as you have done every day. Also add your link to Trello.

##Beta Version

This week, you’ll work towards presenting the beta of your project. 

###Delivering the beta minimum viable product (MVP):
 * Make sure that you have a fully working product, even though it need not be finished in terms of small bugs and code quality. 
 * You cannot add new functionality after today!

Submitting:

You will need to submit your beta code by pushing it to GitHub and adding your link to Trello, as usual.

##Final version

This week, you’ll work towards submitting the final code of your project.  

Delivering the finished product:
 * Make sure that you have a working product to submit. If it does not work, it cannot be considered for grading. 
 * This means that every button should work; i.e., there are no loose end visible to the user.
 * Changing the README.md and choosing a license for your work
 * Your GitHub repository should contain a complete README.md file that states the application name, a couple of screen shots (resized to appropriate width/height for readability), its purpose, your name and a copyright statement. The README should be easy to read.

The copyright statement can be either:
 * a public domain release, which releases your code to the public without any restrictions (you could also use the unlicense for this)
 * a copyright notice which states who actually owns the rights to the materials in the repository (probably only you)
 * Make sure that you have the correct license in your LICENSE file.
 * The README.md should also acknowledge sources of external code, images and other materials that are in the repository but not created by yourself. 
 * Make sure that it is clear which directories are copyrighted by different creators.
 * Also note that these materials have their own respective licenses. You should at the very least note this fact (again, in the README.md). Make sure you also check the licenses to see if you should make a special statement about the source of the materials.

Submitting:

You will need to submit your final code by pushing it to GitHub and adding your link to Trello. Make sure you are not missing anything!

 * The README.md
 * The license in LICENSE
 * The old DESIGN.md (unchanged from week 1)
 * A docs folder for the images in your documents
 * A separate folder containing your project’s code
 * Any configuration files like .gitignore
