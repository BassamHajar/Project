## Project Finished! What Now?

You've just finished your project: your own full-stack application! However, so far you've only kept it to yourself. Wouldn't it be more fun to share it with others? That's what this document is about: how to present your project.

You'll be presenting your project to the rest of the HackYourFuture community. These consist of people of different levels of understanding. Some will understand all the fancy technologies you've used, while others will only stare blankly at what you've just said. That's not helpful.

Instead, we'll be presenting things differently: **talk about your own experience**. Something we can all relate to is another person's experience. What have you learned about development, yourself and HackYourFuture, during these past 6 weeks?

Example: _During the process I have learned the value of working together. While it's not easy to communicate, I've found it helpful to ask my team members for help whenever I get stuck. That way I don't feel like I have to do all of this stuff myself._
