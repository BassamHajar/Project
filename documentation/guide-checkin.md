## The purpose of checking in

In software companies the goal is to most efficiently work together in order to deliver quality software products. Usually, a software team operates according to some kind of development methodology (like Scrum, Agile or Kanban) that helps to maintain focus and reduce miscommunication.

When working a software team you want to **reduce miscommunication** as much as possible. This is because we're dealing with complex topics and ideas, in an ever-changing environment. At the same time you want to make sure that you **understand as accurately as possible** what to do and **how long it will take**. This will prevent any delays or working on the wrong things.

This weekly checkin will serve a similar purpose: by checking in with your project manager, you’ll learn how to focus on what matters most and communicate effectively about your progress.

## Task #1: Personal organisation

A big part of software development is **knowing what to do** and **having a plan of action**. Thus, I’d like you to prepare a short document you’ll be presenting. You have to answer the following questions:

- What is required of me this week? _Define the main task and divide it into smaller tasks_
- In what smaller tasks can I divide the main task and what to do to achieve each task? _Write a basic plan of action for each task_
- How much time do I estimate it will take to finish each task? _Estimate a time and then triple it to be more realistic_
- What is the one biggest obstacle I’m facing in my work right now? How will I overcome this? _Think outside of the box and try to come up with (easy) solutions to the obstacle already_

_Example: Mohammed likes to make lists. He does this to keep overview. Using a tool like [Trello](https://www.trello.com) he puts every big task in a separate board. Of course, he makes sure he understand exactly what's required of him. When he doesn't, he asks for help._

_Then he divides each big task into smaller, bite-sized tasks. That way it'll be more manageable for him to do his work. He assigns to each task a time estimation, so he knows how much time something will take. It will also give him more focus._

_Lastly, he makes sure there are no obstacles in the way. Mohammed spends a little time thinking about what he might interfere or lacking when doing his work. His biggest obstacle is not really knowing where a Node.js server connects to a React frontend. He figures the best way to find out is to look for examples. Maybe the Education Director or teacher can help._

## Task #2: Communication

As a developer you'll be working with a lot of non-technical people. How do you effectively communicate what you're doing?

You need to find the right balance between **knowing, technically, exactly what to do**, task by task, and **knowing how to communicate this simply** to non-technical people.

For the checkin I'd like you to prepare a short transcript of how you would communicate your week's planning to someone that's not technical.

_Example: This week I have to store user data into a database. I have to make a page where a user can type into a form and I have to write the code that takes this information and sends it over to a database._

_Example: This week I have to add a new feature to our website. A user will be able to look up user profiles using a search form. It's a task that will take some time, as I have to do research on the frontend technology side. I estimate it will take around half a day, or 4 hours, to finish it._

_Example: This week I have to update the website and launch the newest version. I have to make sure all the code can smoothly integrate with the old so that there are no errors or other type of bugs._
