When working a software team you want to reduce miscommunication as much as possible. This is because we're dealing with complex topics and ideas.

_The purpose of checking in_:
In software companies the goal is to most efficiently work together in order to deliver quality software products. Usually, a software team operates according to some kind of development methodology (like Scrum, Agile or Kanban) that helps to maintain focus and reduce miscommunication.

This weekly checkin will serve a similar purpose: by checking in with the teacher and I, you’ll learn how to focus on what matters most and communicate effectively about your progress.

_Instructions: what to prepare_:
A big part of software development is _knowing what to do_ and _having a plan of action_. Thus, I’d like you to prepare a short document you’ll be presenting to me. You have to answer the following questions:

- What is required of me this week?
- How much time do I estimate it will take to finish each requirement?
- What do I need to do to achieve each requirement?
- How will I track my progress?
- What is the one biggest obstacle I’m facing in my work right now? How will I overcome this?
  In order to answer these questions you need to make a list. Make a list of what is required and add the time estimations next to it. Underneath each requirement write something about how you’ll achieve it. Then attach a progression bar to it. At the bottom write something about the biggest obstacle you’re facing, and provide a solution.

A good tool to use is [Trello](https://www.trello.com).
